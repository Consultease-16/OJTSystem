this will be base on what day are their submission day. for example the submission is every monday the table cell will show all the monday of the month and it will be label for 1st week 2nd week 3rd week etc
it should be January to June it will show January to June but the system will check what is the current month and that is the one will be shown but the past month will still be shown
then their is check box in the cell per week of the day of submission base on their schedule 

Submission Schedule Plotter will be create another table where  section and submission day will be

then create a new scheme for the monthly attendance sheet, it will be sync also in this
it will just like the Student Requirement, but this is another,

their is a trigger also than when the user clicked a check box it will day-log the day time month year

Create a another table in @staff_sideback named Company Checklist
then create a another page for Company Checklist (named also Company Checklist)
the company checklist has a table 
it should have 

Company List		For City resolution			For Company Signing		Forward to Office of the President		Processed and Notarized	

and then for company checklist in the table cell, the user can add company name in text box format maybe(it should also be editable)
beside it has a function of Check Box	Passed at	Approve/Pending	Returned in
when the user click the check box it will show a check icon and the passed at will automatically show a Month Day Year, Time
the approved/pending is, when the check box is click it will automatically show a pending(it should been highlighted with gold)
but when the user change it into approved(this should be also have a high light of green) the date beside it in the right should also ow a Month Day Year, Time 


for  For Company Signing it has a function of check box	date just the same in above when the user click the check box it will show a check icon  and automatically show a Month Day Year, Time
